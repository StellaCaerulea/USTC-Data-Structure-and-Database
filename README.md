## Introduction

### Motivation

In this repository we aim to offer some certain help for program design in the C language. It also works as a reminder of the proper method for code and documentation. We would try our best to push the required materials one day before the deadline and clarify the documentation.

Feel free to discuss all about it at [Discussions](https://github.com/StellaCaerulea/USTC-Data-Structure-and-Database/discussions). Any questions would be welcome since you have read [*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

### Arrangement

> It takes time to sort the gold from the dross, the wheat from the chaff, the blood from the water.
